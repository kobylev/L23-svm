--- Phase I: Scikit-Learn SVM Implementation ---
Dataset: Iris Flower Dataset
P0 Deliverable: A working sklearn script with high accuracy.
Accuracy on the 3-class data: 0.9333
Trained SVM Model 1 (Class A vs. {B, C})
Trained SVM Model 2 (Class B vs. C)

--- Phase II: Manual SVM Implementation ---
P1 Deliverable: A manual script with recursive logic.
Accuracy of manual implementation: 0.9333

Note: Accuracy is comparable to the P0 baseline, fulfilling the success metric.

--- Phase III (Bonus): Hyperparameter Tuning ---
Objective: Optimizing 'learning_rate' and 'lambda_param' via Grid Search.
Optimization Complete. Best Params: {'learning_rate': 0.01, 'lambda_param': 0.1} with CV Accuracy: 0.9810
Trained SVM Model 1 (Class A vs. {B, C})
Trained SVM Model 2 (Class B vs. C)
Phase III Optimized Accuracy: 0.9111
