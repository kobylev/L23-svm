--- Phase I: Scikit-Learn SVM Implementation ---
Dataset: Iris Flower Dataset
P0 Deliverable: A working sklearn script with high accuracy.
Accuracy on the 3-class data: 0.9333
Trained SVM Model 1 (Class A vs. {B, C})
Trained SVM Model 2 (Class B vs. C)

--- Phase II: Manual SVM Implementation ---
P1 Deliverable: A manual script with recursive logic.
Accuracy of manual implementation: 0.9111

Note: Accuracy is comparable to the P0 baseline, fulfilling the success metric.
